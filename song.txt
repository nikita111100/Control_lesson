It’s a human sign
When things go wrong
Into the boundary
When the scent of her lingers

Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through

And it’s no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It’s two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it’s no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It’s no sacrifice at all
